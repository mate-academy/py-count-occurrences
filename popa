Count Occurrences
Read the guideline before start
Task Description
You are required to implement the count_occurrences function that takes two parameters:

phrase: A string in which to count occurrences of a letter.
letter: The letter whose occurrences need to be counted in the given phrase.
The function should return the number of times the letter appears in the phrase, while being case insensitive.

Examples:
count_occurrences("letter", "t") should return 2
count_occurrences("abc", "a") should return 1
count_occurrences("abc", "d") should return 0
count_occurrences("ABC", "a") should return 1
Function Signature:
def count_occurrences(phrase: str, letter: str) -> int:
    """
    Count occurrences of a letter in a phrase (case insensitive).

    :param phrase: The phrase to search within.
    :param letter: The letter to count occurrences of.
    :return: The number of occurrences of the letter in the phrase.
    """
Guidelines
The function must be case insensitive. This means that both the phrase and the letter should be treated as if they are in the same case (upper or lower).

It is recommended to avoid using loops to solve this task. Instead, consider utilizing Python's built-in string functions to simplify the solution.
